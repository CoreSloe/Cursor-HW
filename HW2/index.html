        <h1>The History Of Street Art</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Street art has a fascinating history. There are times that it has been
          illegal and cities have worked hard to clean it up, and there are
          times that it has been commissioned and cities have paid massive sums
          of money to have more work added to their streets. So, how could this
          <b>form of visual art</b> exist on two completely different sides of
          the legal and social spectrum? We are going to take a deep dive into
          the history of street art to answer that exact question. Let’s start
          with the absolute basics before we weave through the colorful past of
          graffiti and street art.

        <h1>What is Street Art?</h1>
        <p>
          Put simply, street art is a form of artwork that is located in public
          spaces. The most common place to find street art is on walls like the
          sides of buildings, billboards, and other flat surfaces that can be
          easily viewed. In addition to walls, artists utilize sidewalks,
          windows, and even subway cars. Street art is also known as guerrilla
          art, graffiti, urban art, and independent art. It can be used to
          advertise businesses, spread socio-political messages, or just bring
          joy and color to different spaces. It’s expanded beyond just public
          places now. <b>Famous street artists</b> like Keith Haring, Shepard
          Fairey, and Banksy are extremely mainstream, household names, and
          their work is seen on t-shirts and even presidential campaign
          posters.<em>Traditional street art</em>, like the graffiti you’d
          recognize from the <b>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air logo</b> or the side of
          bus stops, is done with paint in aerosol spray cans. Some large pieces
          require additional tools like scaffolding or a cherry picker, but most
          of them are simple and done with just one guy and his or her paint. In
          recent years, the medium has been growing. You will find that some
          artists use new techniques like poster-sized stickers, mosaics made
          with different materials, and even video projections. There aren’t
          rules on what can or cannot be used, which is part of what makes
          street art so special. It’s created for the public to enjoy outside in
          open spaces instead of inside gallery walls requiring tickets for
          admission.
